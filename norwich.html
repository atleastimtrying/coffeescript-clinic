      <blockquote>
        <p>Having to develop and manage multiple web solutions I'm always looking to improve my work flow and write better and more manageable code. Adding CoffeeScript to my tool belt is without doubt a certain improvement. Attending the CoffeeScript Clinic gave me the insight and drive to want to introduce this at work. To me it has a number of advantages but the one I like most is almost being able to write english-esque code making the readability amazing. At the start of the Clinic, it was comforting to know that Anders had prepared some exercises that the group could work from, along with solutions for study.</p>
        <p>I did bring in some code from a single page application I'm working on, but thought I'd go with a solution Anders has intimate knowledge of, and that some other group members would also be doing. The exercises could either be downloaded from his GitHub account or copied off his flash drive. My exercise of choice was a simple JSON generator based upon submitted form feedback. During development, Anders' experience showed when highlighting alternate or better ways to achieve set goals within the code. A real boon. </p>
        <p>The length of the CoffeeScript was about three hours and was a good amount of time to grok the basics of the language and a workflow for using it. The venue itself was a good choice and, as every web developer needs to know, had good reliable wifi. Food and drink was also available throughout the Clinic.</p>
        <p>All in all, if you want to learn CoffeeScript, or write better and more manageable Javascript then I recommended attending a CoffeeScript Clinic.</p>
